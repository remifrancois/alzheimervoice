    "introTitle": "Introduction",
    "introText": "MemoVoice is a cognitive voice fingerprint engine designed for early detection of Alzheimer's disease through linguistic analysis. We take data privacy and patient confidentiality extremely seriously. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect information.",
    "dataCollectedTitle": "Data Collected",
    "dataCollectedText": "We collect voice conversation recordings and derived linguistic features for cognitive analysis. All patient data is pseudonymized and stored with encryption. We extract 25-dimension feature vectors from voice data — raw audio is processed and not retained after feature extraction.",
    "dataUsageTitle": "Data Usage",
    "dataUsageText": "Patient data is used exclusively for cognitive monitoring and clinical reporting. Feature vectors are compared against individual baselines to detect cognitive drift. No data is sold, shared with third parties, or used for advertising purposes.",
    "dataStorageTitle": "Data Storage & Security",
    "dataStorageText": "All data is stored locally on secure servers. API communications are encrypted via TLS. Access is restricted to authorized clinical personnel with role-based permissions. Session data is retained for the duration of the monitoring period.",
    "aiProcessingTitle": "AI Processing",
    "aiProcessingText": "We use Claude AI (Anthropic) for linguistic feature extraction and weekly clinical narrative generation. Voice data sent to the AI is processed in real-time and not stored by the AI provider. All AI outputs are reviewed by clinical staff before being shared with families.",
    "patientRightsTitle": "Patient Rights",
    "patientRightsText": "Patients and their families have the right to access all collected data, request data deletion, opt out of monitoring at any time, and receive explanations of all AI-generated assessments. Contact the clinical team to exercise these rights.",
    "contactTitle": "Contact",
    "contactText": "For privacy concerns or data requests, contact your clinical administrator or reach out to the MemoVoice team."
